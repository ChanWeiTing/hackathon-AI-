## Inspiration 
In corporate environments, frontline employees struggle to allocate ample time for discerning intricate client requirements. Time constraints hinder their ability to effectively extract and understand nuanced preferences.

## What it does
To address this challenge and optimize efficiency, there is a need for an artificial intelligence application. This tool would assist in swiftly generating visual representations of client-desired products, facilitating a more efficient translation of expectations into tangible images.​

## How we built it

We have created a Telegram bot which is able to answer user’s queries and create images by integrating Google Bard as well as OpenAI ChatGPT into the Telegram bot.​

​The rationale for doing this is to provide users a convenient platform for them to seek clarifications, or generate images they want through Telegram, which is a widely used communication application, instead of having to go through the hassle of entering the website

## Challenges we ran into
We run into challenges when searching for working and free api to use for our project requirements

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of intergrating the image genration category and the ai agent category into our project. We are able to use the promting functions of the chatbot to provide users with enough assitance to add to the variations of the image they want to achieve to obtain their final desired product image.

## What we learned
We learnt how to make telebots and use online api using python code

## What's next for AI assisted Visualisation
To add more functions for the image generation such as having users give images they want to add to their image.
